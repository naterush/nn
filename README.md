# Nate's Neural Net

Contained is a single-file implementation of a neural network from scratch. There are no external dependencies, and this will run in Python 3.5.

Simply run with the command `python3 main.py`. 

# Thanks

A huge thanks for [RC](https://recurse.com) for the week within which I embarked on this project. It was incredibly educational: I learned a lot about how neural networks work; I learned a lot about how I worked.

Thanks to all the indivigual folks who helped me in RC; I'll leave you anonymous for privacy reasons, but you know you who are! :) 

Far and away the best online resource I found that helped me through this can be found here: https://cs231n.github.io/optimization-2/
